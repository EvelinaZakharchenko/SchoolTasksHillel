#Exercise 2: Unpack the following tuple into 4 variables
aTuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
#Expected output:
#aTuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# Your code
#print(a) # should print 10
#print(b) # should print 20
#print(c) # should print 30
#print(d) # should print 40
for i in range(len(aTuple)):
    print(aTuple[i])
